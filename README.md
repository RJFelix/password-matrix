# Password Matrix Generator

A simple tool to generate a password matrix to help remember complex passwords.

It's intended to be printed out, perhaps for use on secure systems in secure areas where
no personal electronics or password storage tools are allowed. 

How to use:

1. Choose a short, 4 to 6 letter word or phrase. This will be the key to your password.
2. Generate and print a password matrix.
3. Find each letter or numeral in your word or phrase. The random characters below it are that part of your password.
4. When it's time to change your password, simply generate and print a new matrix! (This is helpful on systems that require frequent password changes.)
5. Keep your matrix in a safe place. If you lose it, change your password immediately.
